 			<p class="grid_7 omega">Thank You! for your interest in the Dayton Gay Men’s Chorus.  We sing a broad range of musical styles from the serious to the sublime…heavy to hysterical. We accept new members at the first three rehearsals in August/September for our Holiday Concert and in January for our Spring Concert.</p>

				<h2>Audition</h2>
				<p>Our requirements are pretty simple… the ability to sing on pitch, familiarity with musical notation, dedication to the choral arts and the desire to become part of a singing, gay  affirming community (and you don’t even have to be gay).  You will be scheduled for an audition time with our Artistic Director(s) which must be prior to the fourth rehearsal of each concert season.   You may bring a solo piece to sing or just sing a simple song (like My County ‘tis of Thee).  He will test your vocal range to help with section placement and also do some basic pitch matching. If your audition is on a Monday night before rehearsal, you may sit in on rehearsal that night and will be told at the end of rehearsal if you have been accepted.</p>

		 		<h2>Rehearsals</h2>
		 		<p>Chorus rehearsals are held on Monday nights from 7 until 9:30 PM at St John’s Lutheran Church at the corner of 5th and Ludlow Streets in downtown Dayton.  We enter through the parking lot on 5th Street.  Regular attendance at rehearsals is essential for your success and the success of the entire group.  Usually two times per concert session, we have optional (though encouraged) sectional rehearsals on other nights of the week.  One time per concert season, we have an all day Saturday retreat/rehearsal.  Additional rehearsals may be scheduled as deemed necessary by the Artistic Director.</p>
		 	</section>
		 	<section class="grid_4 omega">
		 		<h2>Financial</h2>
		 		<p>Chorus dues are $75 per year are collected in three installments in September, January and April.  Our regular concert dress is a tuxedo shirt and vest at a cost of $54 plus tuxedo pants for about $55 that must be purchased prior to your first concert.  You must also provide black belt and dress shoes.  Other fees may be for retreat lunches (usually $5) or for other social events.</p>
